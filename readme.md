PLEASE NOTE: THIS MOD (including this readme file) IS UNDER A HARD WORK AND NOT READY TO USE INGAME FOR NOW !



This mod aims to make a big centralised store, under following conditions:
- To have money, the player has to change the coins he finds naturally ingame at the bancomatic, and then it's stored into player's wallet. 10000 copper coin = 100 silver coins = 1 golden coin = 10000 coins in the wallet

- Any ressource can be sold / bought, with an automatised way to make evolve price: a rare ressource costs lots of money, and a very frequent one becomes cheaper and cheaper.

- A rare ressource that is never traded gains in value with time, because all prices depend on the stock of money into the shop that tends to grow with time. If mithril is never traded, it gains price so player are more interested in selling it.

- The shop always takes more money than gives and has limitations on how much items you can buy / sell at once to make sure you can never gain money by buying - then selling - a same ressource.

- Prices are between 500 and 2 coins, on a stock range between 1 and 20000. With more than 10000, prices are not evolving anymore and stick at 1. The formula is *not* linear.

- The shop admin can choose to keep it always opened or to close it automatically at night. 

- Even the system is supposed to stay independant, the admin can add or remove money from the store for prices regulation.

- The shop can trade, at your option, a type of items, or any


HAPPY TRADING!
